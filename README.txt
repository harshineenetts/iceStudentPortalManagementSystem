This portal encompasses a range of functionalities such as login authentication, managing student records (adding, deleting, modifying, searching), and a logout feature.

Login Authentication:
The project commences with a login system where users input their username and password. The C code validates these credentials to authenticate the user. Upon successful validation, the user gains access to the main menu.

Main Menu:
The main menu provides a list of options accessible to authenticated users. It serves as a navigation hub directing users to various functionalities within the portal. Each menu option corresponds to different operations like listing records, adding new student records, deleting records, modifying existing records, searching for specific records, and logging out.

Functional Modules:
The project contains distinct modules for each operation. For instance, the 'Add Record' module allows users to input student details like first name, last name, address, year, roll number, phone number, year joined, guardian's first and last name, date of birth, and gender. Similarly, the 'Delete Record' module prompts users to enter a student's first name and last name for record deletion. The 'Modify Record' module facilitates changes to student information, while the 'Search Record' module enables users to look up student data based on specific criteria.

Logout Feature:
The portal includes a logout option in the main menu. Upon selecting this option, the user's session ends, and a message "Thank you" is displayed, confirming their successful logout.

Programming Structure:
The C code encompasses event handling, user input validation, conditional checks for login authentication, and menu navigation. It uses functions to manage different sections of the portal, ensuring a structured and organized approach to handling user interactions.
